The first file "Common and non-common elements in Two list" is quite simple to understand where in first loop you find the commom elements
and in second loop your remove the common elements from the first list.All of this is done in python

In 2nd file using python, "Finding thursdays in range of years", first defined the function which describes the condition for the second function 
(weeks) to have 52 or 53 weeks in a year. The condition is easily explained on wikipedia page. Here's the link:
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date". 

The 3rd file makes use of javascript to remove the zeroes from the list. In this defined a empty list apart from the given list. And if the 
element of the given list is not equal to zero than push the elemnt to the new list defined. Finally display the new list which contains
all the elements except zero.
