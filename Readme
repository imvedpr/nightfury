The first file "Common and non-common elements in Two list" is quite simple to understand where in first loop you find the commom elements
and in second loop your remove the common elements from the first list.All of this is done in python

In 2nd file using python, "Finding thursdays in range of years", first defined the function which describes the condition for the second function 
(weeks) to have 52 or 53 weeks in a year. The condition is easily explained on wikipedia page. Here's the link:
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date". 

The 3rd file makes use of javascript to remove the zeroes from the list. In this defined a empty list apart from the given list. And if the 
element of the given list is not equal to zero than push the elemnt to the new list defined. Finally display the new list which contains
all the elements except zero.

Analysis
Nas.py contains the analysis of nas sheets. Initially separated the zero and non-zero values and applied random forest model to come up with 
train and test.
The code is not complete but whatever written is extrapolated then the whole answer can be found out easily.
The code gives information about the influence of variables on maths, same thing can be done for other subjects
Then the subjects can be added and the same algorithm can be used again to see the influencing variables.
To check boys and girls performance, just amke two different sheets one of boy and other of girl and the total performance algorithm found 
earlier can be checked over here.
Similarly for the states where the two conditions will be southern states and other one will be rest of the states.
